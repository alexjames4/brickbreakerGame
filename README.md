# brickbreakerGame

This is my second project using Java. 
Initially I followed this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9qMm3JbOH0&ab_channel=AwaisMirza) by Awais Mirza to help me navigate some of the features of Java.
Instead of using Eclipse I used IntelliJ as my IDE (as I have a student license kindly provided by [iO Academy](https://io-academy.uk/courses/coding-skills-bootcamp/?gclid=CjwKCAiAu9yqBhBmEiwAHTx5pxPMN6wLVoHJ3FhrhZgcKSUmHCZv9xT-tYGRng6yYptUaWIsQ7bYZBoC1vkQAvD_BwE) from the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp)

I intend on adding new features to mess with the physics of the game such as having the ball accelerate on contact with the paddle, difficulty settings and a more randomised collision handling.
